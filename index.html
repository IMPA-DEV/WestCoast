										<p>The two guys were professionally attired. I was on time but they were waiting for me at the storage where I kept my stuff. They were professional in disposition. I have moved around a bit, have been robbed, disrespected and had my stuff broken. They renewed my faith in Movers. I met West Coast Moving Company and will add them to MY LIST! Thank you guys, you are performing a wonderful service at an affordable price.</p>

										<p>West Coast Moving Co is the best. It's our second time using them to move within 1 year and they were great both times. We did a ton of reading and research it really helps to be organized! The crew is detail-oriented, works together like clockwork and observes safety protocol to protect their bodies from the heavy lifting. We made charts of the rooms and areas in our old house and our new house and labeled each box and item with the room letter so they could tell where the items went when we arrived. Before we started, we gave them instructions and did walkthroughs in both houses to show them where things were and where they went. As our things were brought over, it began to feel more like our own home.</p>

										<p>They were done in less than the time minimum with three loading spots and one spot to unload. Very friendly, out going and efficient. We had Thomas and David, and they were amazing. They made our move so much easier and faster than we could ever imagine. I would definitely recommend this company to any one. We will be using them any time we ever have to move from now on!</p>

									<h3>Paul K.</h3>

										<p>This time around, I am so glad we found West Coast Moving. West Coast Moving moved us from Long Beach to Lake Forest on a Friday. They gave us a rate that was highly competitive and all inclusive.  Like the other reviewers stated, no surprises. Everything went very smoothly. They even included wardrobe boxes, packing boxes, blankets, tape, etc. in our hourly rate. The movers seemed to have years of experience and were very safe and professional. They took care of our stuff like it was their own.  Also, unlike previous movers, they left the home we were leaving in great condition so that clean-up was easy.</p>

									<h3>Jessica G.</h3>

										<p>West Coast Moving Company was great. A day or two before the move, I received a call to confirm that all was going according to schedule, and to confirm the exact time window that the movers would arrive  8.30-9.00  On moving day, I received a call from the movers to inform me that they were about 45 minutes away, and they arrived exactly on time. They were very careful with the few boxes I pointed out as being fragile, and there were no damages to any of my belongings. All in all, I had a great experience using West Coast Moving Company and I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.</p>

										<p>Guys were fantastic. They were short-handed, they were supposed to have an additional mover with them but had a scheduling issue. They worked their hind ends off to get the move done as quickly as possible. From the beginning it was a total pleasure to work with West Coast Moving Company . Worked their hearts out and moved faster than I thought was possible. BRAVO</p>

										<p>The guys showed up around 9am. The guy in charge walked me through the steps and was very informative on the proper way of moving. Once I signed the contract the guys started working and they were great. There were 3 of them so the so the move went pretty fast. They wrapped all of my furniture and took good care of the fragile items. They didn't damage anything the whole move. They were very courteous and professional. I was amazed on how smooth the move went. I would definitely use this company again. If anybody needs a moving company I would definitely recommend this one.</p>
